          <li>APA – The Engineered Wood Association. Quarterly production reports.</li>
          <li>Pulp and Paper Products Council.</li>

        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The production and consumption data of structural panels (plywood and oriented strand board) are from APA – The Engineered Wood Association.</li>
          <li>Production and consumption figures for newsprint, printing and writing paper, and wood pulp are based on data of the Pulp and Paper Products Council.</li>
          <li>Data used for lumber production include total softwood production for Canada.</li>
          <li>In January 2019, Statistics Canada noted that they made changes to the sampling and estimation methods for the monthly Sawmills Survey, which is the source of the softwood lumber production data. As a result of these changes, Statistics Canada replaced Table 16-10-0017-01 (which was used in previous editions of the State of Canada’s Forests: Annual Report) with Table 16-10-0045-01 as of January 2019. See Statistics Canada's The Daily for more information.</li>
          <li>Because of changes in sampling and estimation methods in the Sawmills survey, readers should exercise caution in comparing data from different sources directly.</li>
