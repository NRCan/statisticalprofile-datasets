        <ul>
          <li>If a forest area has been certified to more than one of the three sustainable forest management standards (Canadian Standards Association, Sustainable Forestry Initiative, and Forest Stewardship Council), the area is counted only once. Therefore, the total certification for sustainable forest management standards may be less than the sum of the individual totals for these standards. The independently certified forest area is calculated using Forest Management Units, which include streams, lakes, rivers and roads.</li>
