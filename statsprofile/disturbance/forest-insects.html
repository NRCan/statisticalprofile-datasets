        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forest area disturbed by defoliators (e.g., budworms, spongy moth) includes only areas with tree mortality or moderate to severe defoliation. Defoliation does not always result in mortality. Several factors, including defoliation severity, duration and frequency, or presence of other stressors (e.g., drought), can affect the level of mortality.</li>
          <li>Forest area disturbed by bark beetles (e.g., mountain pine beetle, spruce beetle) is derived from aerial surveys that map trees that are dead or dying from successful beetle attack.</li>
          <li>Summing the areas affected by more than one insect to create a grand total can result in an overestimate if more than one insect species occurs in the same stand in the same year. For example, in a mixed wood forest, spruce budworm may defoliate balsam fir in the same stand where forest tent caterpillar is defoliating the aspen trees.</li>
