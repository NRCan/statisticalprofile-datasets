  <p class="mrgn-bttm-lg">Trends in annual greenhouse gas emissions and removals and the area of managed forests. Canada’s forests both absorb carbon and emit atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), which are important contributors to global warming. In any given year, depending on the area of natural disturbances such as forest fires, insect outbreaks and windthrows, Canada’s forests will either be a source of greenhouse gases or a sink of atmospheric carbon. Canada’s forest sector also results in carbon emissions and removals by providing renewable resources to the Canadian economy. <sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></p>

          <li>Environment and Climate Change Canada’s National Inventory Report 1990–2021: Greenhouse gas sources and sinks in Canada is based on data and analysis from Natural Resources Canada—Canadian Forest Service’s National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System.</li>
          <li>For forest lands affected by land-use change, the deforestation and afforestation figures reflect annual rates. Figures for CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions and removal reflect the current year plus the previous 20 years. Thus, the figures for CO2e emissions include residual emissions from areas deforested over the past 20 years, and the figures for CO2e removal include ongoing removal by all areas afforested over the past 20 years.</li>
