          <li>Environment and Climate Change Canada’s National Inventory Report 1990–2021: Greenhouse gas sources and sinks in Canada is based on data and analysis from Natural Resources Canada—Canadian Forest Service’s National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting and Reporting System.</li>
          <li>For forest lands affected by land-use change, the deforestation and afforestation figures reflect annual rates. Figures for CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions and removal reflect the current year plus the previous 20 years. Thus, the figures for CO2e emissions include residual emissions from areas deforested over the past 20 years, and the figures for CO2e removal include ongoing removal by all areas afforested over the past 20 years.</li>
